| ID          | INTEGER    |                    
| CITY        | VARCHAR(21)|                     
| STATE       | VARCHAR(2) |                           
| LAT_N       | NUMERIC    |                            
| LONG_W      | NUMERIC    |                            
+-------------+------------+                            

4) Observation Station 2 Write a query to print the sum of LAT_N 
   and the sum of  LONG_W separated by space, up to 2 decimal places 

5) Weather Observation Station 13. Write a query to find the sum of  
   the Northern Latitudes having values greater than 38.7880    
   and less than 137.2345 up to 4 decimal places  

6) Weather Observation Station 14. Write a query to find the greatest value 
   of the Northern Latitudes less than 137.2345 up to 4 decimal places. 

7) Weather Observation Station 15. Write a query to find the corresponding 
   Western Longitude value for the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes 
   less than 137.2345 up to 4 decimal places.  

8) Weather Observation Station 16. Write a query to find the smallest value   
   of the Northern Latitudes greater than 38.7780 up to 4 decimal places.  

9) Weather Observation Station 17. Write a query to find the corresponding 
   Western Longitude to the smallest value of the Northern Latitudes 
   greater than 38.7780 up to 4 decimal places.  

10) Observation Station 18. Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) be two points on 2D plane,   
    where (a, b) be minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude and (c, d)   
    be minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude. Write a query to print   
    the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 up to 4 decimal digits.  

11) Observation Station 19. Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) be two points on 2D plane,   
    where (a, b) be minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude and (c, d)   
    be minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude. Write a query to print   
    the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 up to 4 decimal digits.
